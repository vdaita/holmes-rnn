# holmes-rnn
This is the checkpoint file from when I trained hunkim's word-rnn-tensorflow trained on Sherlock Holmes.
You will need to download this checkpoint file and head on over to hunkim's repository for how to either train from this model or generate text.
If you want to submit a checkpoint that is trained more, please make a pull request with the checkpoint file, and this README.
